The Papachos project is based on the development from scratch of a website created for a fictional restaurant that offers the best hamburgers in Valencia. The main objective was to develop a web project from scratch with specific requirements. The design is inspired by a Peruvian restaurant and a New York restaurant, combining styles from both to create a unique appearance. The website is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes, and features a dynamic menu that uses JavaScript to show and hide its options.

## Requirements and basic quality:
- Header with logo and navigation menu
- Presentation section with image and text
- Menu section with a list of hamburgers and their prices (minimum 4, maximum 6)
- Footer with links to social media
- The website must be fully responsive and adapt to different screen sizes
- Use Flexbox or CSS Grid for the layout
- Use at least one animation or transition with CSS
- CSS should be written in BEM
- The navigation menu should be functional (open and close)

## The development process of the project was carried out as follows:

- Project structure: A basic project structure was created, including the necessary HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript files, as well as the chosen tools to start the project.
- Development of basic elements: The project was gradually developed, focusing on one section at a time. Functionality and elements of each section were implemented first, such as the menu or section structure.
- Design details: Once the page was functional, the menu was working, and it had the basic information, work began on design details, such as incorporating images, selecting colors, and filling in missing sections.
- Responsive details: With all the elements that would make up the page in place, time was dedicated to aligning the grid and creating media queries for tablet and desktop, considering a mobile-first approach.
- Final details and animation selection: The remaining details were polished, and the appropriate animation was chosen. For example, a slider that affected page efficiency and loading speed was discarded in favor of another animation that prioritized accessibility and performance.
- Final testing: Finally, the page was shared on different devices and browsers to verify its correct functionality and ensure a good user experience.


# Tools used:
- HTML and CSS
- SASS as a CSS preprocessor
- NPM as a package and dependency manager
- Gulp, a task automation tool (WSK)

# Explanation of the starter kit:
It is a project template with preinstalled and preconfigured functionalities, including an HTML template engine, the SASS preprocessor, and a local server that automates tasks.

The kit consists of 3 types of files and folders:

- Files located at the root of the repository, such as gulpfile.js, package.json... (not to be modified)
- The src/ folder: these are the files of our web page, such as HTML, CSS, JS... (can be edited)
- The public/ and docs/ folders, which are automatically generated when the project is started (using npm run docs). The Kit reads the files inside src/, processes them, and generates them inside public/ and docs/.

# Steps to start the project:
1. Install the dependencies by running the command -> **npm install** (Node.js must be installed beforehand)
2. Run the command -> **npm start**
